Homework 4 contains all 3 parts of my homework 4 assignment

Part 1: By using object oriented programming and inheritance, I created a demonstration of a parent class and child classes. The child classes Square, Circle, and Rectangle are child classes to the parent class Shape. Shape contains methods such as calculating area, diagonal distance/diameter and perimiter, and the child classes are able to access those methods via inheritence.   

Part 2: After copying any sort of text, upon running part 2 will look through whatever is currently copied into your clipboard, and by using Regexes, is able to extract all phonenumbers and all emails that appear in the copied text. Once extracting all of them, the program prints to screen each unique instance of that phonenumber and email.

Part 3: The user must enter a password that is at least 8 characters long, contains a capital/lowercase letter, and contains 1 digit. Upon entering the password, the password is checked to see if it fulfills all 3 parameters by the use of regexes. The user will repeatedly be asked to enter a password until one has been entered that satisfies all parameters.
