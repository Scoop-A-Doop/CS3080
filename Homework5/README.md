Homework 5 contains all 3 parts of my homework 5 assignment

Part 1: I created my own iterator class that iterates through an array backwards.

Part 2: I created my own generator function that given a number, will find pythagorean triplets up to that number. (ex. passing in 10 will output 10 pythagorean triplets)

Part 3: I recreated the range() function via a generator. Given a stop argument and optional start and step arguments, iterate through the numbers given the appropriate arguments. This results in a much lower memory cost while still iterating through numbers just like a standard range() call.
