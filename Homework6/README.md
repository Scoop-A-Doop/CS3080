Homework 6 contains all 3 parts of my homework 6 assignment

Part 1: I slightly adjusted a decorator provided by the professor to allow for custom arguments to be passed in that affects the main decorator function.

Part 2: I created a cache decorator that is used for calculating the fibonacci sequence upto a certain number. It stores all previously calculated numbers, so that the program does not need to recalculate them for higher numbers, instead is able to retrieve the previously calculated numbers stored in a dictionary. This drastically reduces runtime.

Part 3 (mcb.py): I created a script that will store into a file, whatever is currently copied in your clipboard. By passing in "save" and an additional argument that acts as a keyword, it adds to the file that keyword and whatever is in your clipboard. You can then run the script again with said keyword as the only argument and it'll copy the contents associated with that keyword into your clipboard. You can also pass in "list" and it will list all keywords you have entered into the file.
