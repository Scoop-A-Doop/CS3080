This program asks the user several security questions all contained in a while loop. Upon answering all security questions correctly in a row, a secret will be revealed. 
The purpose of this program is to demonstrate understanding the many features and syntax of Python, so each question will be unique in that they demonstrate something 
that the other questions has not already. This may be the use of a new command, the use of a new data type etc. 
Only one module is imported, that being the random module so that I can demonstrate the use of the randInt function.
