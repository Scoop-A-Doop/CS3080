Homework 3 contains all 4 parts of my homework 3 assignment

Part 1: Using a nested for loop, print a 2d array that is sideways so that it is right side up

Part 2: Given any string, using a dictionary, keep track the number of occurences for every single character in said string. The dictionary only contains characters found in said string, so the code adds the characters accordingly. Characters include letters, punctuation and white spaces.

Part 3: Given a pre-defined dictionary representing an inventory (item | stock count), I made an add function that will add onto the stock count if the user wants to add onto the stock count of an existing item. If that item is not already recorded in the inventory, add it. A delete function also exists to remove 1 stock from a specified item, while preventing the user from removing an item whose stock count is 0. A function also exists to neatly print out the function

Part 4: Using a dictionary, partially simulate a game of Tic-Tac-Toe. The dictionary contains keys that represent the location on the board and values that represent the character that exists on that location ('X', 'O', or empty ' '). Functions exist to print the board and to fill in a spot on the board given a location. A while loop then runs continuously until either player quits, each player being able to input their turn one at a time.
